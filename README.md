## 🤖💡 About me
A Data Science enthusiast who learns by **building, breaking and rebuilding.**
For me, coding isn't just lines on a screen - it's a way to bring ideas alive, whether it's an AI Assistant that talks back, 
a model that predicts outcomes, or a productivity tool that maked life simpler.

📚 Currently diving deep into Generative AI, Neural Networks, and End-to-End ML pipelines

🛠 Hands-on learner: I prefer projects over theory, but I back it up with solid fundamentals

🌍 Exploring intersections of Data Science × AI Products × Real-world Impact

💡 Believe in: “If you can imagine it, you can prototype it”

🎯 Goal: Build solutions that are practical, personal, and powerful
